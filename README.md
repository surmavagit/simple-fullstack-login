## Simple full-stack login app

This is a full-stack app with a login system. The app uses [_Moonrepo_](https://moonrepo.dev/) (a monorepo management tool) for easy setup and launching of the app.

To run this project, you need to install the `moon` command first by following the installation guide [here](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/install).

Once installed, run `moon run :dev` to download tools, setup the project, and launch the project in the terminal.
